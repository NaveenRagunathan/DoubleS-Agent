# Double S Agent Backend Software Design Document (SDD)

## 1. Overview
The Double S Agent backend is a scalable, secure API platform powering the next-generation Substack growth assistant. It orchestrates AI content generation, analytics, user management, and integrations with external data sources (web scraping, social APIs, email services). The backend is designed for high availability, extensibility, and data privacy.

- JWT-based Authentication (stateless, scalable)
- Role-based Access Control (admin, user, trial, etc.)

### 2.2. Newsletter Analytics Service
- Growth Metrics Tracking (subscribers, open rates, conversions, etc.)
- Event Logging (content published, headline tested, etc.)
- Custom Insights Engine (recommendation API for actionable suggestions)
- Data Aggregation (daily/weekly/monthly stats)

### 2.3. Content Generation Service
- AI Content Generation (integration with LLM providers)
- Template Management (Viral formulas, playbooks, email sequences)
- Content Storage & Versioning (drafts, published, history)
- Tone/Style Customization (prompt engineering, user presets)

### 2.4. Headline Laboratory
- Headline Generation API (AI-powered, formula-based)
- A/B Headline Testing (track open rates for different headlines)
- Headline Scoring (psychological triggers, curiosity/exclusivity scoring)

### 2.5. Audience Research & Insights
- Niche Discovery Engine (web scraping, Substack API, trend analysis)
- Competitor Analysis (scraping, 3rd-party APIs)
- Content Performance Analytics (what works in a given niche)

### 2.6. Growth Strategy Planner
- Playbook Library (CRUD for growth strategies)
- Step Tracking & Progress (user can check off steps, receive reminders)
- Personalized Recommendations (AI/ML based on user progress)

### 2.7. Email Sequence Builder
- Sequence Template Management

## 4. Database Schema (High-Level)

- Users
- Newsletters
- Content
- Headlines
- Analytics
- Playbooks
- Sequences
- Referrals

## 5. API Endpoints (Sample)

- Auth & User: /api/auth/register, /api/auth/login, /api/user/profile, etc.
- Content & Headlines: /api/content/generate, /api/headline/generate, etc.
- Analytics: /api/analytics/newsletter/:id, /api/analytics/insights
- Audience/Niche: /api/audience/trending, /api/audience/search
- Growth Tools: /api/playbooks, /api/referral/invite
- Email: /api/email/sequence, /api/email/send

---

## 6. Security & Privacy
- All sensitive data encrypted at rest and in transit
- API rate limiting and input validation
- GDPR/CCPA compliance
- Secure API key management

---

## 7. Extensibility
- Modular microservice-friendly design
- Easy to add new AI providers or analytics sources
- Webhook/event-driven for integrations

---

## 8. Deployment & Ops
- Dockerized services
- Environment-based config
- CI/CD for test, build, deploy
- Monitoring: Prometheus/Grafana, Sentry
